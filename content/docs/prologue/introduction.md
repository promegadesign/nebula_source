Nebula is the design system for Promega, a biotech company based in Madison, WI, USA. It is a central resource for component information, design rationale, and best practices.

Promega.com uses Sitecore as our content management system. Sitecore is managed by the WUX team in Marketing Services.

## Overview of Site Sections

* **Getting Started**: This section includes information about Nebula itself, as well as basic information about our site. Check here for browser support, breakpoints, and additional resources.
* **Foundations**: Here's where we share our design rationale for foundational elements. Some information can be found on our [Brand Portal](https://promega.widencollective.com/portals/rrxinhb5/PromegaBrand), but we use Nebula to further define web-specific styles and patterns.
* **Components**: Detailed information on our Sitecore components. This includes styles and variants, modifier usage, and best practices.

## Design System Patterns

We use {{< red-link title="red links" url="#" >}} to indicate pages that are planned but have not been fully completed.
