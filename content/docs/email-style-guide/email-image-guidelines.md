## Image Optimization
### Sizing Images for Use

All email images should be created at 72ppi and sized to fit the content area.

**Example** - An email is 640px wide. If you are creating hero image to span the width of the email, the image you are creating should be 640px wide and whatever height you have determined. An image that is placed in a two column row should be no wider than 400px. 400px ensures that the image will still look good on a mobile device when it increases in size.
Images should be created at the appropriate file size without losing clarity. This can be achieved through the image export settings in Photoshop.

**Acceptable image formats**:
* .png – Used for transparent background images. Export as an 8bit image to reduce file size.
* .gif – Used for limited color images and animations. File sizes should be kept under 75kb.
* .jpg – Used for all full color images and has the best file size control options. Keep files sizes under 150kb for header images and 75kb for body images.

After exporting your image for the web, run your image files through an optimization tool.

**Remember: The larger the image file, the longer it the email takes to load and the more mobile data your user will have to use.**

## Image Upload, Keywords, and Alt Tags
### Naming, Image Tagging, and Alt Tags in Dynamics for Marketing

When uploading images into Dynamics for Marketing (D4M), it is important to name your image correctly, tag it with keywords, and give it an alt tag.

**Image Naming Format** -
[Country or Department 2-digit Code]-[Year]-[Image Name]

Example: MS-2021-ISFG-PreEvent-39836731

**Keywords for Image Tagging** -
Tag your uploaded images with CRM keywords that are associated with the content found in the image.

**Add Alt Tag to All Images** -
After adding an image to your email, click on the image to add an alt tag. This allows users that have HTML turned off or screen readers to be able to identify the content.
