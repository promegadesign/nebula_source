## Content and Creation
Getting a recipient to open an email is hard enough, but sending an email that doesn’t display properly or contain relevant information, makes it even harder.

**All Email Clients Are Not Made Equal, Nor Are Recipients**

Each email client can display elements of an email differently, or not at all.

Here are a few tips:
**Do not use background images or videos** – Background images and videos do not render in most email clients.
* Solution – Save the background image with the text and other elements embedded, and then place the image in the email. For videos, save an image with a play icon on it and link the image to where the video is hosted.
**Keep it simple stupid (KISS)** – Emails should contain a clear and concise message that leads the recipient to a call-to-action. This ensures the highest engagement rate.
**Target your sends** – It’s tempting to send an email to all of your contacts, but segmenting them by interest and previous engagement will ensure the best results.
**Test and test again** – Be sure your email is rendering properly in the most
popular email clients.
**A/B Testing** – This is the process of sending two or more emails to a small percentage of your contacts. A winner is determined and the remaining percentage of contacts will receiving the most engaging email. This is a great way to understand the type of design or messaging that is most relevant to your contacts.

## Naming Conventions

How to label your emails and other assets in Dynamics for Marketing

For organization purposes and easy searching, use the following name convention:

[Branch or Department Code]-[Year]-[Main Descriptor]-[Secondary Descriptor]-[Project Number (if applicable)]

For example, a Marketing Services email from 2021 for the ISFG PreEvent would look like:

MS-2021-ISFG-PreEvent-39836731
